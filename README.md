What is docker ?
Docker is a platform and set of tools designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that can encapsulate an application and its dependencies. Docker provides a standardized way to package, distribute, and manage these containers, making it simpler to develop, deploy, and scale applications across different environments.
